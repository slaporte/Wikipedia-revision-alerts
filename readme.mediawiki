Use '''Wikipedia revision alerts''' to receive email updates for terms that appear in users, article titles, or edit summaries. For example, add an alert for the term "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion" to receive an alert when an article is nominated for deletion.

== Installation ==
* Uses python and sqlite.
* Run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

== Operation ==
There are two services:
* <code>alert_monitor.py</code>: service for monitoring recent changes and sending alerts
* <code>alert_server.py</code>: web service for adding or modifying alerts, runs on localhost port 8080 by default

It requires an SMTP server to send email notifications. It by default, it uses localhost.
